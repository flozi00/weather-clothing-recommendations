# Weather-based Clothing Recommendations

This project is a website that uses the user's location to fetch the current weather conditions. Based on the weather data, it recommends appropriate clothing combinations (e.g., warm clothes for cold days, light clothes for hot days). The website includes options for different types of activities (e.g., casual, formal, sports) and allows users to save their favorite clothing combinations for future reference.
